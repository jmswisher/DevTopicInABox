# Meetup Box Template

This directory is a template you can use to create a meetup box.

## Contents of this directory

* README.md: This file should contain notes and links about the topic.
* /demo/: Put the source code of the demo here.
* /slides/: If you have HTML5-based slides about the topic, put them here.

You might add files containing a step-by-step script for demoing the code, or a transcript of the linked video, if there is one.

## Resources
Replace the following with appropriate links.

* Video: Link to a video about the topic.
* Articles: Link to articles about the topic.

## Learning Objectives
What should meetup participants be able to *do* (not merely "know") as a result of the meetup?
Take a look at the [Webmaker Web Literacy Map](https://webmaker.org/literacy) for examples of learning objectives. 
* Objective 1
* Objective 2

## Hands-on Activities
Encourage participants to download the demo code. (Or provide it on media if your meetup venue does not have a good Internet connection.)
Think of hands-on activities they can try that will help them learn about the topic. These activities should be related to your learning objectives.

* Make {some change} to the code. How does that affect the results?

## Discussion Questions
Probably the participants at your meetup will have plenty of questions of their own. However, you might come prepared with some questions to spark discussion. Ideally, these are questions that don't have a single correct answer, but where people might have differing opinions. 
Also, if a particular question or topic generated a lively discussion during your meetup, you can record it here for the benefit of other meetup leaders.
