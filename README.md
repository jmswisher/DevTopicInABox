#Dev Meetup In A Box
===============

This repository houses resources for leading developer meetups. Each "box" contains a collection of resources about a particular topic related to web development or web app development, such as Web APIs, useful libraries, or developer tools.

## What is a "meetup box"?
Elements of a "meetup box" can include:

* Notes about the topic and the contents of the box.
* Demo code that illustrates the topic.
* Demo script for demoing the code OR link to a video demoing the topic.
* Suggested hands-on activities for meetup participants.
* Suggested discussion questions or topics.

## How to use a meetup box
To lead a meetup using a meetup box, you should:

1. Download the resources.
2. Review all the resources to become familiar with the topic. Be sure to get very familiar with the demo code.
3. Practise the demo script, or make sure that you can play the video.
4. Lead your meetup using the resources.
5. Submit issues or pull requests if you have any problems to report or improvements to contribute.
