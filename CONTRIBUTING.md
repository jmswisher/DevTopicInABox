# Contributing to DevTopicInABox

## Ways to contribute
The main ways to contribute to this project are:
* Improve an existing topic box 
* Translate a topic box into another language
* Contribute a new topic box

## Minimum requirements
A topic box *must* contain at least the following elements:
* A *code project* that demonstrates the topic. This is obviously a must for API topics. Even if the topic is about a developer tool, provide a sample file or project that people can use to play with the relevant features of the tool (for example, for a CSS tool, provide a CSS file and an HTML file that uses it). If you don't have a code project, you need to make a persuasive argument why code is not relevant for the topic.
  * Follow [best practices for example code](http://www.developer-evangelism.com/code.php) to make your code project self-contained and practical.
  * Document *any* external dependencies (even jQuery), to ensure that others can find everything needed to run your code.
  * All media (graphics, video, audio) files included with your project must be openly licensed to enable others to copy them.
* A *script for demoing* the topic. This is a list of actions a presenter takes to demonstrate the API, tool, etc. 
* *Presentation notes* outlining the main points that a presenter should make about the topic. 

## Optional elements
* Presentation slides, preferably in an HTML5 slide format. As with code, follow [best practices for slides](http://www.developer-evangelism.com/slides.php) rather than just putting your presentation notes into bullet points.
* Video about the topic. This can be a screencast of a demo, an interview with an expert on the topic, or whatever makes sense for the topic. If the video shows a demo, use the same script as is in the topic box, so that viewers can follow along locally.
* Suggested activities for participants. Suggest something that people can try to do with the code that goes beyond what is in the demo script. If you give a challenge, be sure to include at least one possible solution.
* Suggested discussion questions, for participants who are learning about the topic together to talk about. These should be open-ended issues that there may be a variety of opinions about.
* Links to other resources. If there are articles on [Hacks](http://hacks.mozilla.org), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org), or elsewhere on the Web, be sure to reference them in the README.md for the topic box.
