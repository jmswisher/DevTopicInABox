# Meetup Box Template

This directory is a template you can use to create a meetup box.

## Contents of this directory

* README.md: This file should contain notes and links about the topic
* demo/: Put the source code of the demo here.
* slides/: If you have HTML5-based slides about the topic, put them here.

You might add files containing a step-by-step script for demoing the code, or a transcript of the linked video, if there is one.

## Resources
Replace the following with appropriate links.

* Video: Link to a video about the topic.
* Articles: Link to articles about the topic.

## Learning Objectives
What should meetup participants be able to *do* (not merely "know") as a result of the meetup?
Take a look at the [https://webmaker.org/literacy](Webmaker Web Literacy Map) for examples of learning objectives. 

## Hands-on Activities
Encourage participants to download the demo code. (Or provide it on USB sticks or other media if your venue does not have a good Internet connection.)
Think of hands-on activities they can try that will help them learn about the topic. These activities should be related to your learning objectives.
